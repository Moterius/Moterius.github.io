# Introduction

Hi! I'm Moterius, and I am trying to bring my creations to all of you. That includes games as well as stories.
I am working under my online name on  [Fimfiction](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/339279/Moterius), [Fanfiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/~Moterius) and [Github](https://github.com/Moterius/), but I will not create accounts on Facebook, Twitter or Instagramm. If there are some under my name, they are false.
Also, on the wattpad website, someone probably from russia (because when I enter my name it turns the website russian) took my name, that's why I'm using the name thatMoterius there.

## Stories
I'm currently working on both Pokemon and pony (MLP:FIM) stories.
## Games
The game I am currently working on is 'NightmareNightmare', in which you replay the events of MLP:FIM season 1 episode 1&2 as the infamous Nightmare Moon. A 'proof of concept' draft that has roughly twenty-five minutes of gameplay can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rlbae4A5LZHAxYVfPypj7UCcZMwkKVus).
Please note that this is not the prototype of the game itself, but rather a sort-of playtest for concepts and the engine.
